## Welcome to the 30-Day Generative AI Master Plan!

Generative AI is one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields in artificial intelligence. From creating stunning images and realistic speech to writing compelling text and complex code, generative models are transforming how we interact with technology and unleash creativity.

This comprehensive 30-day plan is designed to guide you from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, equipping you with the knowledge and practical skills to master Generative AI. Each day is structured to provide:

*   **Clear Objectives:** What you will learn and achieve by the end of the day.
*   **Core Concepts:** In-depth explanations of the key ideas.
*   **🧠 Math & Stats Focus:** The underlying mathematical and statistical principles that make these models work.
*   **📜 Key Research Paper(s):** Pointers to seminal papers with links, allowing you to delve into the original breakthroughs.
*   **💻 Project:** A hands-on coding exercise or practical exploration to solidify your understanding.
*   **✅ Progress Tracker:** A checklist to help you monitor your learning journey.
