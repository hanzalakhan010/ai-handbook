# Introduction to 90 Days of ML

This documentation tracks my journey through a 90-day exploration of machine learning. 

Here, you'll find summaries of my daily progress, key concepts I've learned, code examples, and reflections on the challenges and insights gained along the way.

This project is a living document, and I'll be adding to it as I progress through the 90 days. I'll also be adding extra information, such as links to useful resources, and notes on topics that I want to explore further.

Let's get started!
